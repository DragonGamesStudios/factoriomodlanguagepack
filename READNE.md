# Factorio Mod Language Pack
This mod is a mod localization pack. It's supposed to handle translations for as many mods as possible. Feel free to collaborate. This is the main goal of the project.

# Rules
1. Edit ONLY the contents of locale directory. Do not add dependencies under any circumstances.
2. Locale file for any mod should have the path "locale/language_here/mod_name_here.cfg". It's very important for organization.
3. DO NOT sabotage others' work. If you're doing a correction, please provide an explanation.
4. You can, but you don't need to credit yourself in your (and only your) translation files.
5. Every PR messages and issues (if any) should be written in English.
6. Any pull requests ignoring rules above will be discarded.
